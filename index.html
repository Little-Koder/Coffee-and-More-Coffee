                    <h2>Coffee Basics</h2>

                    <h3>What Coffee Is</h3>
                    <p>Coffee is a <em>brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans</em>, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>

                    <p>Coffee is <em>darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans</em>, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). <br> It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served <br> with <strong>coffee cake or another sweet dessert</strong>, like <strong>doughnuts</strong>. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis). <br> Clinical research indicates that <strong>moderate coffee consumption</strong> is benign or <u>mildly beneficial</u> as a stimulant in healthy adults, with <em>continuing research on whether long-term consumption has <u>positive or negative effects</u>.</em></p>

                    <h2>Some Coffee History</h2>

                    <p>Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the <br> modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods. <br> The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th <br> century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a much more global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.</p>

                    <p>According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Jimma in Ethiopia were the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant. However, <br> no direct evidence that has been found earlier than the 15th century indicating who among the African populations used it as a stimulant, or where coffee was first cultivated. <br> The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered the stimulating effect of coffee when he <br> noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.</p>

                    <p>Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. According to an old chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), <br> Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from Mocha in Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab (modern-day Wusab, about 90 kilometres (56 mi) east of Zabid, Yemen). <br> Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery but found them to be too bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard. <br> He then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid, <br> Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mocha, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.</p>

                            <p class="big-letter">It Wasn't Always Called Coffee!</p>

                            <p><blockquote>When coffee was first discovered, it wasn’t called coffee but ‘Qahhwat al-bun,’ which, when translated from Arabic, means ‘the wine of the bean.’
                                
                                Over time, it was shortened to ‘Qhawa,’ and then the Turks later changed to ‘Kahve.’
                                
                                It didn’t stop there as it became popular in the Dutch language as “koffie,” which is where its English equivalent was borrowed.
                                
                                Coffee found its way into the English dictionary sometime in the 16th century.</blockquote></p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Buy your freshly roasted whole coffee beans in small batches. Beans that are exposed to the air or sunlight will go rancid. <blockquote></blockquote></li>

                            <li>
                                Purchase unbleached coffee filters that fit in your coffee maker. If you doubt whether your coffee maker has been cleaned in a while, take some time to clean it for the best possible taste. Run it on the cleaning mode (or a simple brewing mode) with a mixture of half distilled white vinegar and half water. <blockquote>Follow up with two additional brews with water to ensure that the vinegar residue has been completely removed.</blockquote> <blockquote>For areas with very hard water, include a larger ratio of vinegar to water. Repeat the cleaning every month.
                                </blockquote></li>

                            <li>Grind your beans daily in a burr or blade grinder right before brewing. Burr mills provide the most even grinding; however, they are much more expensive than small blade grinders. If you use a blade grinder, rock it several times during grinding to produce more even grounds. <blockquote>Try out different sized coffee grounds. The finer the grounds, the more flavor you will get from them; however, they can also result in a more bitter brew.</blockquote></li>

                            <li>
                                Use approximately two and three-fourths tbsp. of coffee per eight oz. cup. With time, you will see how many scoops of coffee beans will produce this amount of grounds. Adjust the amount to your taste. <blockquote></blockquote></li>
                                
                            <li>Opt to turn off the automatic warming feature on your pot. Most coffee makers are programmed to brew at a perfect 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius), but the warming feature can boil the brew, making it taste bitter. For best results, drink the freshly brewed black coffee right away.</li>

                    During the reign of the Ottoman Empire, people were punished for drinking coffee. This may sound a bit drastic, especially since the punishment was usually death, but rulers believed coffee was a narcotic and banned it from consumption.</li>
